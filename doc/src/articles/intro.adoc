Do you have to use Git every day, but never learn it for real?
You're in the right place.
I'll begin from the very beginning and  explain to you why this tool is very important for software developement.

// git-scm c'est le livre mais aussi le site officel
// tout le monde devrais livre au moins dles 3 premiers chapitres
To make it short, Git helps to track changes in your code base.
No need to keep a zip for each version anymore.
Also working in teams becomes easier.
That's why a majority of software editors are using Git.
Usually,  developers don't learn it at school but rather as they go along.
The result is we often have to stuggle with Git to be able to share our work with our colleagues.

If you visit the link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2[official git website], you'll find the Pro Git book.
I read it and I think explainations are cristal clear.
You should give it a try, every developers should at least read the three first chapters.

....
- Réécrire l'histoire: Changer les commit squash et amend, changer message de commit, (règles push --force, reset --hard), revert sur premieère partie en plus ??
- remettre un fichier à zéro (checkout --)
- fait n'importe quoi -> distant --hard
- puul rebase avec changements -> il fallait rebase
- en vrai le merge c'est pas que des branches mais des pull request avec possiblement des forks
Règles
- Ne pas rebase un truc partagé
- pas reset - hard ou push - force
ne parle pas de github ou gitlab ni fork/pull request
____Hall of Fame
- reflog pour récupérer un commit perdu

== Fast intro for busy people

Let's first understand why you need to use a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[Version Control System (VCS)] in you project.
Imagine you need to write an article about Vue.js vs React.

You come up with an intermediate version of your `vue-vs-react-1`.
At this point, a friend of yours will check for typos and you'll keep writing the rest. 

The problem is you end up with two versions of your document : `vue-vs-react-2` and `vue-vs-react-1.5`.
That's bad, you'll have to review the two versions and make a third up-to-date version out of it.
Maybe `vue-vs-react-3` or worst you'll still use `vue-vs-react-2`.

It becomes worst if you want to write this article with co-authors.
Everyone has its own version of the article.
Regularly, someone have to fetch all version, merge them all in one new version and give it back to the others.
You end with dozens versions of your article.
You don't know what each version are for and you get headaches trying to merge regularly.

That's why developers give birth to VCS such as Mercurial and Subversion (SVN).
Nowadays, Git is widely used across the industry and the most famous VCS.
We'll only talk about how to use Git here.

For sure, Git will help you to keep clear versions of your work.
But learn how to use it isn't a clear fast path, the learning curve is steep.
You'll loose your work and maybe make other lose their work in the process.
