= Resolve conflicts with yourÂ team

We talked about how git is great because it allows to share the very last version of the codebase with your team.
This was all thank's to the `git push` command which sends your local commits to the server.

It's time to learn how to keep your local repository up-to-date with the remote.
Actually, it's recommended but also necessary if you want to push but don't have the last commits.
The opposite of push is pull.

Run a `git status` to know if you're up-to-date with the remote.
Our local branch (more on that later) is master.
The local copy of the remote branch to retrieve updates is named origin/master.

[source=bash]
----
$ git status
On branch dev
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/dev'.
----

It says you have the very last version but it's not necessary right.
To make sure you're up-to-date, you have to pull before.
This will retrieve the last version of master and copy it into origin/master.
Finally, git will try to merge master and origin/master.
That's why you can get conflicts here.

From this point you may be in three situations:

* No local commits nor modified files = No troubles
* No local commits but modified files = Not a big deal
* Local commits (not pushed) = Keep calm and carry on

If you didn't commit or modified files (without commit) since your last push, you're safe, no conflicts ahead.
But you may have modified files, don't want to commit but still want to be up-to-date.
This is easy to do with the `stash` command.

[source=bash]
----
$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop
----

There is no magic here. Behind the hood, git makes an hidden commit of all the modified files.
With `stash pop`, it recovers the changes from this hidden commit and delete it as nothing happened.
Except you're know up-to-date with the remote and keep your modified files.

Now comes the worst and most common scenario.
You have local commits and there are conflicts with the remote new commits.
The bad news is you may get more conflicts as the difference in commits between the local and the remote increases.
To avoid this, pull regularly for updates.

Git has two commits, the local and the remote commit but can't merge the two.
It's solution is to ask you to resolve the conflict manually.
Check the repository status and you'll see unmerged files in a specific part.

That's not recommended to resolve conflicts by editing the files.
Conflicts in files are not very user friendly and its long to solve.
You may prefer to use a specific tool or your IDE.
If your IDE don't offer this kind of feature you can use the link:http://meldmerge.org/[open source and multi-platform Meld}.

This is what a conflict looks like.
Three different versions of the same file.
Usually, the middle version is the final one which will be keeped.
Yet, it's always hard to figure out if your version is on right of left.
I have no advice about this, try to look at the changes and see if its yours or not.
Then you'll be able to tell which one is your version and which one is the remote version.

Usually, the remote changes are right because it was pushed before.
My precious pieces of advice is to copy/paste the remote version in the middle.
It means, the final file will be the remote one and you only have to merge two files instead of three.

To flag the files with conflicts as resolved, you must make add them to the stagging area and commit.
There two ways Git can handle this special merge commit depending on the pull strategy: *rebase* or *merge*.

By default the pull strategy is set to merge but you can switch if you add the `--rebase` option.
With the merge strategy you'll get a merge commit containing your updates which solves the conflict.
If you choose rebase, your local commit will be updated with the updates.
Rebase is an automatic task which tries to apply your commit on the top, you must use `rebase --continue` to keep going after a conflict.
The later is the better in you ask me.
On another hand, merge commits helps to locate commits which corrects conflicts.
This is useful if you made a bad merge and remove a bit of your colleague code.

You can also handle merges with a tool such as Meld and flag the files as resolved automatically.
This can done by defining a link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_external_merge_tools[mergetool in your git configuration].
When a conflict occurs, type `git mergetool` to make git use your software to review the files.
After each files, it'll ask if you confirm the merge or not.

Do you know cherry-pick?
It's a handy command which allows to pick any commit and put it on top of your branch.
Conflicts can also occurs with cherry-picks but it works the exact same way as rebase.
When you encounter a conflict, fix it and call `cherry-pick --continue`.

[source=bash]
----
$ git cherry-pick COMMIT_SHA1
